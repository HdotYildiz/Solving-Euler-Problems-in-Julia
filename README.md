# Solving Project Euler problems in Julia
The goal of this work was to learn Julia syntax and functionality by solving mathematics related questions. The questions used are the famous [Project Euler questions](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

## Contents
The repository contains a [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook. This is a Jupyter style notebook environment for Julia which outputs the work as a pure Julia file. One of the big benefits of Pluto.jl is its dynamic environment, changing one cell instantly shows effects on any other related cell.
